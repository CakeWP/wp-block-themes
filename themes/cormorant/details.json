Gifu City in Gifu Prefecture, Japan is famous for a traditional fishing method called Ukai (cormorant fishing). That's how I came up with the name. Simple design, universal designed fonts available, many block patterns and styles. You can use for blog, single page for business, self portfolio, and more.
